<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various medical parameters. The prediction is made using a decision tree classifier, a simple and intuitive machine learning algorithm.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, class, which indicates if the patient has diabetes.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To run the notebook, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

<h2>Usage</h2>
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-predictions.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd diabetes-predictions

Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook "Diabetes Predictions.ipynb"

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
Diabetes Predictions.ipynb: The main notebook containing the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction steps.
diabetcsv.csv: The dataset file (make sure to include or provide a path to the dataset if itâ€™s not in the repository).
